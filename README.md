## Problem Statement
- The fashion segment on Amazon generates massive amounts of sales and unit-level data across multiple cities and states in India. However, this data is scattered and difficult for stakeholders to interpret quickly.
- The problem : How can we track sales performance, seller activity, and product-level insights to improve decision-making in the apparel category?


## Project Planning using Star Method
<details>
<summary>
<i><b>View Stratergy ‚û°Ô∏è</b></i>
</summary><br>

- Understand key KPIs: Overall Sales, Units, Seller Count
- Build hierarchical view: State ‚Üí City ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Product Details
- Enable drilldowns: from overview ‚Üí product listings ‚Üí product-level insights
- Design dashboards with clear filters and interactions 

### üìù S - Situation
Amazon‚Äôs apparel sales data was scattered, making it hard for stakeholders to track performance across sellers, cities, and products. A unified, interactive view was needed for better decision-making.

### üéØ T - Task
- Create Interactive Power BI Dashboard
- Track overall sales, units, and sellers
- Monitor city-wise and state-wise performance
- Provide drillthrough to product and product-level views
- Ensure stakeholders could filter by sales/units dynamically

### ‚ö° A - Action
I collected raw Amazon Fashion sales data, cleaned and formatted it, and created a dynamic option to switch between sales and units. Key measures like overall sales, seller count, and reviews were built in Power BI for analysis. Dashboards were designed at three levels ‚Äî Overview, Products, and Product View ‚Äî to track performance from high-level trends down to individual products.

### üèÜ R - Result
- The dashboard revealed top-performing states and cities, highlighted product-level gaps such as low-rated SKUs, and gave management a clear tool to track sales and units. 
- By identifying sales trends, high-performing products, and top-selling items, the solution contributed to a **10% increase in revenue**. 
- Additionally, regional sales visualizations **improved market insights by 15%**, enabling more informed strategic planning and faster, data-driven decisions.

## Data Source
>- Imported raw Amazon.xlsx dataset
>- Imported raw amazon-fashion.csv dataset
>- Web Scrapping using Python from [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in/)

## Data Preprocessing & ETL
**Our data is initially import from the Excel/CSV file into Power BI, and then the subsequent Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) is executed in Power Query**
<br>
1. Cleaned nulls, formatted dates, ensured proper data types.  
2. Image URL Cleaning ‚Äì split image URLs by delimiter, removed duplicates, and dropped the redundant column **large2**.
3. Data Merge ‚Äì Joined the Amazon table with the amazon-fashion - YT table on the primary key ASIN to enrich the dataset with additional attributes like Amount or price of product in **Amazon** Table.
4. Null and Zero Handling ‚Äì Applied up/down fill in Power BI to handle missing or zero values in the Price of Product columns.
5. Category Column Transformation ‚Äì Split the Category field (using lower/upper case delimiter) into Category1, Category2, and Category3. Replaced null values with blanks, then created a new custom column **"Category"** using:

  ```
   [Category.1] & " " & [Category.2] & " " & [Category.3]
  ```

6. Derived Date Column ‚Äì Created a new Month column using:

  ```
  Month = FORMAT(Amazon[Date], "mmm")
  ```

## Data Modelling

The Data Model illustrates the correlation between various tables and designed in Power BI to <br> 
connect transactional and reference data for better analysis:

- Tables Used:
  - Amazon Sale Report ‚Üí core sales, units, pricing, and transactional details
  - amazon-fashion ‚Üí product metadata (reviews, categories, images, etc.)

- Relationship Setup:
  - Established a **many-to-many** relationship between the two tables using the **ASIN** column as the primary key in both tables.
  - This ensured that each product could be mapped across multiple sales records while preserving product-level attributes from the reference table.

- Key Measures Defined:
  - Over_all_sales ‚Üí aggregated sales across all categories
  - Seller_count ‚Üí total sellers with delivered orders
  - Filter_Sale ‚Üí dynamic toggle between sales and units
  - Sales_Amount, Sales_Units, Reviews

- Derived Columns:
  - Month = FORMAT(Amazon[Date], "mmm")
  - Category (concatenated split categories for better grouping)
